# What's BEÅ AMEL?
It's a css kit based on 3 files:
1. besamel.css
2. generated.js
3. components.css


## besamel.css
This file contains the layout and styles (meaning margin, padding and so on) of the page and components.

## generated.js 
This file generates some styles on client side. For example .w-6, .m-w-12, ...

## components.css
This is the file you are to edit to create you own design. To help you get started, there are variables the beggining of the file. Use those variables in the for consistent design and for light/dark mode support.
